# Word-Embeddings-with-Sentiment-Classification
Word Embeddings and Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews

This is an introduction to word embeddings. It contains complete code to train word embeddings from scratch on a small dataset, and to visualize these embeddings using the Embedding Projector.

## Visualize the Embeddings

To visualize our embeddings we will upload them to the embedding projector.

Open the Embedding Projector (this can also run in a local TensorBoard instance).

    Click on "Load data".

    Upload the two files we created above: vecs.tsv and meta.tsv.

The embeddings you have trained will now be displayed. You can search for words to find their closest neighbors. For example, try searching for "beautiful". You may see neighbors like "wonderful".
